# Lead-Acid-Battery-Charger
 Lead-acid battery charger designed to safely and efficiently charge lead-acid batteries.


## Project Summary

Design and implement a PWM-based constant current charger for a 12V lead acid battery with a maximum charging current of 1A. The system operates from a 230V AC input and follows the batteryâ€™s charging profile: constant current followed by constant voltage.

## Technical Specifications

- Input Voltage: 230V AC  
- Charging Current: Max 1A (constant current mode)  
- Control Method: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)  
- Circuit Components: Basic analog components (resistors, capacitors, transistors, diodes)  
- Microcontroller Use: Only for user interface, not for core charging control  
- PCB Design: Created using professional EDA tools and optimized for manufacturability  
- Enclosure: Designed using CAD software for safe and ergonomic housing  

## Development Process

- Circuit simulation (e.g., Multisim, LTspice)  
- Breadboard prototyping and testing  
- PCB layout and fabrication  
- Enclosure modeling and manufacturing
